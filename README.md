# Project-3-Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning-

The "Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning" project aims to 
develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having a 
heart disease based on various health-related features. The system will 
utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data and make 
predictions, contributing to early disease detection and proactive healthcare 
management.

It uses 4 machine learning model and gives the accuracy of each particular model
The 4 models are : Logistic Regression , Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Desicion Tree
